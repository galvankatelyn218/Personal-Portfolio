        <div class="description">Cancun</div>
        <p>This picture is one of my favorites. I took it on a cheap disposable film camera and was not expecting to like it as much as I do. </p>

        <div class="description">Skydiving</div>
        <p>I am a firm believer everyone should skydive at least once in their life. The addrenaline is unforgettable and the views are insane.</p>

        <div class="description">Oregon</div>
        <p>This trip was extra special to me because it was my first solo trip. I somehow made it home safely even after being lost in the forest for a few hours.</p>

        <div class="description">Chino Hills State Park</div>
        <p>One of my favorite hikes, Chino Hills State Park. Definitely an underated spot, with tons of different trails.</p>

        <p>Laguna is my go to beach in California, the scenery is beautiful! Also their acai bowls are quite tasty.</p>

        <div class="description">Hawaii</div>
        <p>I took this picture at a lookout spot in Hawaii. Hawaii is somewhere I can see myself living in someday.</p>

        <div class="description">Wakiki, HI</div>
        <p>Another picture of Hawaii, this day was especially fun because it was raining and I had rented a bike. The weather felt fresh and it was a fun way to exercise for the day. </p>

        <div class="description">Sunset</div>
        <p>This pictures funny to me because this was taken on the roof of my house.
            I was pretty scared of the height which is ironic beacuse just one year later I would be jumping off a plane.

        </a>
        <div class="description">Hawaii Botonical garden</div>
        <p>This picture was also taken on a cheap disposable camera, and is also one of my favorites. This garden was especially cool beause it looked very similar to a scene youd see in Jurassic World.
