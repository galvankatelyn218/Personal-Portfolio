        <div class="description"><strong>Arranging Inputs</strong></div>
        <p>In this discussion post, I created a flowchart program that takes user input, stores the numbers in an array, and then displays the maximum element in descending order.
         This project challenged me because it was more of a complicated flowchart compared to my more simpler projects due to it mainly requiring inputs to be arranged in descending order.</p>

        <div class="description"><strong>Multiplication Exercise + Calulating User Age</strong></div>
        <p>This project includes two excercises. 
            Excerise #1 defines two functions, 'mult' and div', for mulitplication and division.
            The main function takes user input for two numbers, performs multiplication and division using the defined functions, and then prints the results. 
            Exercise #2 defines a function 'ageCalc' and a 'Main' function. 
            The 'Main' function asks user for their birth month and year until a valid input is provided.
            It then calculates the user's age using the 'ageCalc' function and prints the result.    
        </p>

        <div class="description"><strong>Calculating Area + Perimeter</strong></div>
        <p>This programs main objective is to calculate the area and perimeter of the provided shape inputs.
          I enjoyed this project because it ties both math and psuedocode into one. It was also easy to organize because of the creation of two seperate classes, square and rectangle.    </p>
